# Restrict Markers

![Bad map markers](/Data/Picture.png)

This simple mod restricts map markers to only share to other players if they are nearby. Players can no longer rely on magically shared markers to communicate positions on-the-fly. Instead, detailed mission planning is encouraged, as players must huddle around to share map markers. In the field, effective use of verbal communication is emphasized. You can't always rely on having a high tech digital networked interactive map, and this mod makes the map behave more like a basic paper map.

## Features

- Player created markers are local to your own map by default.
- Markers automatically share to other players within 7 meters.
- Optional Zeus modules to toggle the mod on/off during mission.
- Compatible with vanilla and ACE markers.

## Setup Instructions

- Server side mod, not required on clients.
- No dependencies on other mods.

## Troubleshooting

### Markers don't show up for other players even when they are nearby?

Ensure you select the correct channel (group, side, etc) when creating the marker, as channel restrictions still apply.
